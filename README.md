# rproxy
SMTP relay proxy with OAUTH2

This will act as a mail relay accepting incoming mail using simple SMTP authentication and forwarding to an external mail server using OAUTH2 authentication.
In addition to its functionality this will serve as a playground/testbed for understanding OAUTH2 for use in other applications.
